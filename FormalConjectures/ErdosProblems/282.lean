/-- Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be an infinite set and consider the following
greedy algorithm for a rational $x$: choose the minimal $n\in A$ not used so far such
that $n\geq 1/x$ and repeat with $x$ replaced by $x-\frac{1}{n}$.

This process of subtracting unit fractions is modelled in `greedyUnitFractionRem`.
At each step `t : ℕ`, the function `greedyUnitFractionRem A x t` returns the remainder
of `x` with respect to the first `t + 1` unit fractions, with distinct denominators taken
from `A`. Once the remainder reaches `0` it stays `0`, and the process terminates. This
corresponds to producing a representation of `x` as the sum of distinct unit fractions with
denominators from `A`, however this function does not return this representation. -/

/-- Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be an infinite set and consider the following
greedy algorithm for a rational $x\in (0,1)$: choose the minimal $n\in A$ not used
so far such that $n\geq 1/x$ and repeat with $x$ replaced by $x-\frac{1}{n}$. If this
terminates after finitely many steps then this produces a representation of
$x$ as the sum of distinct unit fractions with denominators from $A$.

Does this process always terminate if $x$ has odd denominator and $A$ is the
set of odd numbers? -/

Graham has shown that $\frac{m}{n}$ is the sum of distinct unit fractions
with denominators $\equiv a\pmod{d}$ if and only if
$$\left(\frac{n}{(n,a,d)},\frac{d}{(a,d)}\right)=1.$$
Does the greedy algorithm always
terminate in such cases?

Graham has also shown that $x$ is the sum of distinct unit fractions with
square denominators if and only if $x\in [0,\pi^2/6-1)\cup [1,\pi^2/6)$. Does the
greedy algorithm for this always terminate? Erdős and Graham believe not - indeed, perhaps it
fails to terminate almost always.
